"""Shared identity-stamp helper: "were these artifacts derived from exactly this request?"

The resume-identity check for a landed cube and the flatten-skip stamp are the SAME question
asked about two different artifacts, so they
share ONE mechanism rather than each growing its own. A stamp is a small JSON sidecar recording
the caller-visible identity of the request that produced an artifact -- never a modification
time (two unsynchronised clocks, and a blob's `Last-Modified` cannot carry "when
this content was produced" across a copy at all). Mirrors the shape of DVC's `dvc.lock` / Bazel's
action key: a record of what defined the work, compared by equality, never by age.

Fails towards running: a missing, unreadable, or malformed stamp is treated as "no match" (never
raises) -- the caller then does the work rather than trusting a stamp it cannot make sense of.
