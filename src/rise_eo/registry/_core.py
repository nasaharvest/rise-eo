"""The registry mechanics `rise_eo.model.registry` and `rise_eo.image.registry` share: version
allocation, `_aliases.json`, `_complete.json`, the publish loop with its collision retry.

Every function here is generic over the file set (`list[tuple[rel_path, bytes]]`) and the
digest of what landed -- no bundle-specific or image-specific content is assumed.
`content_digest_fn` is the one thing a caller supplies: "digest the directory at this path",
because what counts as a version's content differs per registry (a bundle's manifest-declared
files; an image definition's `image.json`). The user-facing parts -- ref parsing, name checks,
their messages -- stay in each registry.

The concurrency guarantees (what a reader and `publish` can rely on, and what is not
guaranteed) are stated in `rise_eo.model.registry`'s module docstring; `write_new_version` below
carries the publish-loop proof they rest on.

    last, returning the version that actually holds them. `files` are written in the
    caller's order. No staging prefix, no directory rename -- `storage.fs.rename` is not
    used here.

    `content_digest_fn(path, storage_options)` digests what a version directory holds,
    over the same file set the caller's `digest` covers (a bundle's manifest-declared files;
    an image definition's `image.json`).

    Three steps land in order: (1) write every file straight into `v<N>/`; (2) re-digest
    what actually landed and confirm it equals the caller's digest -- publishing is only
    complete once the bytes are provably the caller's, the same proof
    `rise_eo.model.registry.migrate` uses to accept a copy; (3) write `v<N>/_complete.json`
    **last**, carrying that digest. A single-object write is atomic on every backend rise-eo
    targets, so step 3 is the all-or-nothing moment a directory rename would otherwise
    provide.

    A target that already exists and is complete is a genuine collision only if it does not
    hold the caller's digest, in which case the loop retries at `v<N+1>` -- idempotency,
    reached without writing anything. A target that exists but is *not* complete (an
    interrupted publish) is nobody's, so it is **cleared** and rewritten; clearing is what
    keeps the previous attempt's undeclared leftovers out of the version the re-digest is
    about to bless. A target whose freshly landed bytes do not match the caller's digest --
    two publishers interleaving files at the same `v<N>` -- is left unmarked and the loop
    moves on rather than claiming it.

    A target without `_complete.json` is invisible to `list_versions`, whatever files it
    holds, and is cleared by the next publish that allocates its number.

    Bounded at `MAX_PUBLISH_ATTEMPTS`: the loop retries only genuine version
    collisions, so an unbounded run here would mean something is structurally wrong, not a
    transient race.
